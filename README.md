## Project Overview
Countless individuals rely on authentication systems to safeguard their personal and professional lives, from accessing secure accounts to protecting sensitive data. Yet, traditional password-based systems remain vulnerable to breaches, phishing attacks, and weak password practices, leaving users at risk.
Addressing this critical security challenge, this project is set on developing a user-friendly face and eye recognition authentication system.
